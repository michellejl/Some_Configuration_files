## Homebrew + Cask
Can't live without homebrew. Pretty much always my first install. I like how easy it makes it to install all the other things.

Add homebrew cask to install programs instead of just command like applications. 

# JavaScript Things

## [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)<br />
Allows me to use multiple versions of node and jump between them easily <br />

Install script: <br />
```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash```

Gives me access to ```node``` and ```npm```
