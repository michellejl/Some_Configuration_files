# Some of my favorite tools

Below I have listed a few tools / programs I use rather frequently. My main computer and my work computer are both Apple. Haven't looked into these or alternatives for other operating systems.

## Alfred
  Replaces the default spotlight bit. I have the powerpack and have gotten benefit from adding a few workflows. [Website](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## aText
  aText is a text expander. I use it to insert a variety of code snippets that I don't always remember, or bits I don't want to always have to type out. This is a paid program, but not very expensive. Certainly cheaper than many of the alternatives I have seen and it works well enough. [Website](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/)

## Bartender
  Sticks all the menu bar programs inside of one icon so that it is less crowded. Not a major need, but helps me stay more focused. [Website](https://www.macbartender.com/)

## BetterTouchTool

## Cheatsheet
  If you hold down on the command key, a window will pop-up and show shortcuts that are available for the current program. [Website](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/)

## Dash
  I have this tied in with Alfred to allow me to look things up in various documentations without having to jump into a browser and finding the information online. [Website](https://kapeli.com/dash)

## iTerm2
  Replacement for default terminal app. Adds many features and customization options.  [Website](https://www.iterm2.com/)
