# Just for Fun

## [asciiquarium](http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/)
alias as 'fishies', this gives me entertainment and my daily dose of ascii-art!

## [cowsay](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay)
Provides the dragon greeting at the beginning of my terminal sessions. <br />
Use ```cowsay -l``` to list all available art critters.

## fortune
Generates a random quote or "fortune". Sometimes I add this to my cowsay and lolcat pipes to give the critters things to say.
<br />
``` fortune | cowsay | lolcat ```

## gti
Entertains me with a fast moving GTI car that zooms across my screen when I make a typo while trying to do a git command.

## lolcat
Gives me fancy rainbow outputs. I often pipe this on the end of cowsay commands.
<br />
```cowsay -f dragon "Howdy" | lolcat```

## sl
Entertains me with a steam engine that moves across my screen when I make a typo while trying to list the files in the current location.


# General Tools

## [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
  Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command

## [z](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/07/become-command-line-power-user-oh-my-zsh-z/#using-z-to-jump-to-frecent-folders)
ZSH Plugin or homebrew install. It builds a list of the folders you frequent most often and allows you to jump to them quickly without typing the whole path out.


# Programming Usefulness
## git
  Git is always needed. It is just a fact.
## nvm
  **DON'T install from homebrew!** It doesn't install in the place that zsh is going to want it. It will work, but not show up correctly when trying to display the version of node in the prompt. Install it from the [website](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

# Work Specific:
  * awscli
  * mariadb
  * openssl
